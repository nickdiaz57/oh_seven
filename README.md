# OhSeven

This program provides a CLI that allows users to view information about the ships and engineers of Elite Dangerous. Users are able to retrieve a list of all ships currently playable in the game and find information about a ship of their choosing, including the manufacturer, price, armor, shield, speed, and hull mass values.  Users can also retrieve a list of all engineers accessible in the game, along with their locations and the components they work on.
